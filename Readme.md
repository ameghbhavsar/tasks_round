#### Introduction

Welcome to the task round repository of
[Swarm Robotics IIT KGP](http://swarm-iitkgp.github.io/). This repository
will be used to store all the archives for the tasks round from over the
years.

#### Convention

Make a folder for the year for eg. `2017` inside that make two more folders
`software` and `embedded`. Now place the LaTeX files inside those folders
and also add a `Readme.md` which will contain the link for the sharelatex
document.

**Note:** We will be using [sharelatex](https://sharelatex.com) to make all
of our LaTeX files. So it is advisable to do the same.
